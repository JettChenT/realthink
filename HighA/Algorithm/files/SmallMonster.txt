Autumn wind with my heart, autumn wind with my love, autumn wind drifting leaves, autumn also unconsciously came to my side, autumn wind must know my mind. Although I don't have the autumn style, maybe I don't have the connotation of autumn wind, but autumn wind seems to understand my heart better. I sometimes ripple in the autumn wind, I sometimes linger in the autumn wind, I sometimes intoxicated in the autumn wind. The autumn wind is generous, free and implicit in my eyes. In a sense, the autumn wind seems to contain all the beauty of time. She can make people forget the troubles of the world, comfort the lonely and sad people, and make people more mature; she can blow the horn of progress to the frustrated people, so that people are no longer afraid of the ups and downs on the way forward...
Autumn gives people the feeling that there is no decoration, no cover up, although there is a slight sadness, there is also a time of light sentiment, she makes many lonely people have the feeling of "the end of the world falls into people". The lingering autumn rain is like the talk of an old friend and a confidant. Harmonious resonance is in it. I like the lingering autumn rain, I like the murmur of autumn rain, I like walking under the autumn rain, I like to think about my mind in the autumn rain. Perhaps, the autumn rain gives me the feeling that "spoil or disgrace, see the flowers blossom and fall in front of the courtyard; leave unintentionally, see the sky clouds roll up and down."
Autumn is a lovely season. Every ripple of the autumn wind will stir up endless emotions in my heart. Dreams flying in the breeze of study; smiles like songs at the autumn rain; smells the fragrance of light chrysanthemum like dreams. The attachment to autumn is a little unable to extricate itself, hate autumn can not stay forever, love autumn go back to autumn. Autumn is the same as the four seasons. Time is like water. Autumn is going to go. Once sad, also want to say goodbye, so, autumn always quietly come, and quietly go, I will let myself in the autumn wind always calm and peaceful. The beauty of autumn, the moving autumn will let me mature, will let me in the future days, less impetuous, more a quiet, will let themselves look at the world with more rational and more mature eyes.
I hope the autumn wind can dry every dark and humid corner, I hope the autumn rain can wash away every ordinary tiny dust, I hope that the lingering autumn wind can let the passionate people enjoy the warmth of autumn, until forever. Autumn wind with dreams, flying in their own sky; Autumn wind with feelings, enjoy rooting and germination in their own soil! I like the autumn wind, I like the autumn clouds, I like the high clouds in autumn, I like the thoughts and expectations of autumn.
